\section{Reliability System}
The aim of the reliability system is to make caring for and upgrading equipment
more involved and more rewarding beyond the simple considerations of horse power
and work speed.

Equipment failure checks should be carried out once per month when the equipment
is first used that month. Additional penalties to reliability should be applied
if the equipment was not stored properly (e.g. stored dirty, or left outside).

The older the model of the equipment used, the higher the chance of failure.
Chance of failure should also increase depending on what condition the equipment
was when it was bought.

Roll 1d100, if the result is equal or than less the failure chance, then the
equipment has suffered a failure and needs to be repaired before it can be used.

Major and minor failures can happen independently of each other i.e. both can
happen at the same time or neither. I.e. roll the check once for each.

Reliability penalties from different sources are cumulative. E.g. A tractor
stored in a shed which only has two walls, while dirty, with maintenance 20\%,
paint 0\%, and was bought at used rating B would have additional minor failure
probability of 14\% $(2\% + 3\% + 2\% + 4\% 3\% = 14\%)$ as per table
\ref{table:equipment_fail_rates} (p. \pageref{table:equipment_fail_rates}).

\TODO{This can and should be simplified to a single roll.}

\subsection{Harvest Quality and Storage Spoilage}
Various factors can damage the growing crops and thus have a negative impact on
the ammount and quality of the harvest of a crop (drought, pests, plague, etc.).

Roll 1d100 once per harvest season (e.g. just before harvesting a certain crop).
